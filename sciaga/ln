Flag	Description
-s	Create a symbolic (soft) link instead of a hard link
-f	Force overwrite: remove existing destination file without prompting
-n	No dereference: treat destination that is a symlink as a file, not its target
-v	Verbose: show what is being done (helpful for debugging/scripting)
-T	Treat destination as a regular file, even if it exists as a directory
-r	Create relative symlink (not in all versions of ln, e.g., GNU only)
-b	Make backup of each file that would be overwritten
--backup[=METHOD]	Use with -b to specify backup method (e.g. simple, numbered)
--target-directory=DIR	Put the symlink into a specific directory instead of using full destination
